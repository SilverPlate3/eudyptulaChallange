My answers to the Eudyptula Challenge. <br>
The Eudyptula Challenge is a series of 20 tasks regarding the Linux Kernel. <br>
Each task touches a different aspect of the linux kernel. The tasks vary from: <br>
Sending a kernel patch that fixes a [Sparse](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.12/dev-tools/sparse.html) warning <br>
to, adding an ioctl that changes the volume label of a mounted fat32/fat16 filesystem. <br>
